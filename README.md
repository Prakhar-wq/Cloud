							Cloud Project



Problem Statement: Create an access control mechanism in a public cloud, wherein the
identity is verified in the private cloud and is federated.

Description:
The Project solution comprises of two parts.

Part 1: The adminstrator assigns permissions to users according to their roles/identities. Each role has one or more access rights which are again decided by adminstrator.The Single Sign-On facility is guaranteed as the identity of a particular users are verified once and all the accesses which are given to them can be used.

Part 2: The user uses the credentials given to him by the adminstrator so that his identity is verified by that. The access rights have been already decided by the adminstrator according to the access policies which takes cares of which rights certain users should have as per as their roles and identites.
